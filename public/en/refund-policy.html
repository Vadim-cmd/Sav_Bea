            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

            <p>
                Within 5 days from the moment of your payment, you have the right to request from
                Sav Bea a refund of the money you spent on the purchase of the course
                (masterclasses). At the same time, you must specify the reason for the return in the
                request. Refunds for paid master classes are made at Sav Bea's sole discretion.
            </p>

            <p>The application review period is 3-10 days from the date of sending the request.</p>

            <h2>YOUR REQUEST MUST INCLUDE:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the workshop for which you wish to receive a refund</li>
                <li>
                    A detailed description of the problem and the reason for the refund request.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RETURN REQUEST REVIEW PROCEDURE:</h2>
            <p>
                Each request is considered individually, on a first-come, first-served basis and
                takes time to process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your return request has been approved, the manager will notify you. The return
                process itself can take up to several weeks, depending on the payment method, your
                bank, and other reasons.
            </p>

            <h2>WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE REFUNDS:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>if you are suspected of dishonest actions</li>
                <li>
                    in case you violate the requirements of the current legislation, the terms of
                    the contract, or the Rules for using the service, as well as the use of this
                    platform and its materials for unlawful, illegal, and prohibited actions
                </li>
                <li>if the reason for the refund is not specified</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>REFUND TERMS</h2>
            <p>Refunds are made if one of the following conditions is met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the user provided a reasonable reason for dissatisfaction with the purchased
                    master class
                </li>
                <li>within 1 day if you mistakenly paid for access to master classes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In other cases, refunds are made at the discretion of Sav Bea</p>

            <h2>REFUND PROCEDURE</h2>
            <p>
                Refunds are made in the same way as payment for access to the Service. We always
                return funds only to the payment method by which we received the funds from you. For
                example, if you paid for the Service with a VISA / MASTERCARD card, the refund is
                made by canceling the transaction (refund) and, as a result, the refund can only be
                made to your VISA / MASTERCARD card. Refund terms depend on which payment method was
                used.
            </p>
            <p>
                When processing a refund, a service fee or bank/payment system refund fee may be
                charged, which is deducted from the amount to be refunded.
