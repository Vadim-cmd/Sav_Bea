            <h2>Y. Files-Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of
                letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and stored by the
                browser. Subsequently, the identifier is sent back to the server each time the
                browser requests a web page from the server. Cookies can be either "permanent" or
                "session": permanent will be stored by the browser and will be valid until the
                expiration date, unless deleted by the user in advance; "session" ones, on the
                contrary, will be deleted after the end of the session with the site or after
                closing the browser. Cookies usually do not contain any information that identifies
                the user. However, your personal information that we have may be linked to
                information stored and obtained from cookies.
